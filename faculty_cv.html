          Philosophy of Learning
        </h2>

        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>My personal learning philosophy is deeply influenced by cognitive constructivism and sociocultural constructivism. These theories shape my understanding of how individuals learn, construct meaning, and engage in the learning process within social contexts. I believe in an inquiry-based approach where students construct their own understanding of concepts and are challenged to reshape their schemas when faced with new information.</p>
          <p>Cognitive constructivism (Piaget) focuses on individual learning, where students experience disequilibrium when their existing schemas are challenged. Given time, each student will construct new knowledge as they bring themselves back into equilibrium at their own pace. On the other hand, sociocultural constructivism (Vygotsky) emphasizes group interactions and collaboration. Students learn best when they are first introduced to new knowledge through guided instruction and then given opportunities to practice and engage with peers in a safe and diverse environment. (Powell & Kalina, 2009)</p>
          <p>Personally, I find that a combination of both cognitive and sociocultural constructivism is most effective for student learning. By incorporating individual and group work, I aim to provide students with varied learning experiences that cater to their diverse needs and preferences. This approach allows students to construct knowledge independently while also benefiting from collaborative learning experiences. Overall, my goal is to create a dynamic learning environment where students can actively engage with content and interact with their peers to deepen their understanding.</p>

          Teaching Philosophy
        </h2>

        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>My teaching philosophy is focused on fostering collaborative minds through a cognitive sociocultural constructivism approach. I recognize that students learn about their world by constructing new information from their existing knowledge and assumptions. I strongly believe that learners benefit from an active learning environment focused on critical thinking and collaboration with other students.</p>
          <p>I promote active learning strategies in my classes to engage students in meaningful activities to construct their own knowledge. Students are encouraged to take ownership of their learning process through activities such as problem-solving, group discussions, and hands-on projects. I create a collaborative and inclusive classroom environment where students are encouraged to work together, share perspectives, and learn from one another's diverse experiences. Through collaborative projects, group discussions, and peer feedback, students develop important interpersonal skills while enriching their understanding of the subject matter.</p>
          <p>Critical thinking is a core component of my teaching philosophy. I challenge students to question, analyze, and evaluate, information rather than simply memorizing facts. By posing open-ended questions and encouraging students to explore different viewpoints, I foster intellectual curiosity and empower students to think critically about the world around them.</p>
          <p>I employ scaffolding techniques to support students as they tackle challenging concepts. By providing appropriate guidance and support, I help students build on their knowledge by gradually increasing the complexity of tasks as their understanding deepens. This approach fosters independence and self-directed learning while ensuring that students feel supported throughout the process.</p>
          <p>Assessment is used not only to evaluate students' understanding but also to provide feedback and support their ongoing learning process. I employ a variety of assessment methods, including formative assessments, peer evaluations, and self-reflections, to gauge student progress and identify areas for improvement. Assessment tasks are designed to align with learning objectives and encourage deep understanding rather than rote memorization.</p>
          <p>As a faculty member, I am committed to continuous reflection and improvement. I regularly reflect on my teaching practices, seeking feedback from students and colleagues, and adjusting my methods as needed to better support student learning. I strive to create a dynamic and responsive learning environment that meets the evolving needs of my students.</p>
          <p>By integrating cognitive constructivism with a focus on building a sociocultural environment, this teaching philosophy aims to empower students as active participants in their own learning while fostering collaboration, critical thinking, and lifelong learning skills.</p>
