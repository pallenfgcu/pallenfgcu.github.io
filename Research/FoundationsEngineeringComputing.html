            <h4>EGS 6055: Course Description</h4>
            <p>Having taken this course as a student, I learned and applied principles of inclusive, learner-centered, and evidence-based pedagogy and assessment in engineering and computer science learning environments. The course leveraged a human-centered design approach to develop us as educational designers and supported the integration of learning theory and research on pedagogy and assessment into our instructional practice. Through a combination of research literature and practical application, we gained insights into how students in engineering and computer science learn, enabling us to craft learning objectives, align assessment methods with objectives, and iterate on our educational designs to create inclusive and learner-centered environments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="w3-panel w3-left-align">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Software Engineers must be able to design, construct, test and maintain software across a wide
                variety of applications, platforms, and industries (Software Engineering, 2024a). A Software
                Engineering degree program combines topics across Computer Science (CS) and Software
                Engineering (SE) disciplines (Software Engineering (BS), 2024b). CS curriculum includes
                object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, operating systems, and computer
                organization and networking (Software Engineering (BS), 2024b). SE curriculum includes
                software engineering fundamentals, software requirements engineering, software architecture
                and design, software testing, and team-oriented senior software engineering projects (Software
                Engineering (BS), 2024b).</p>
            <p>Course CDA 3200 Digital Systems & Architecture is one of two courses that fulfils the
                Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) requirement that the SE program
                provides “exposure to computer architecture and organization” (Criteria for Accrediting
                Computing Programs, 2020 – 2021, 2021). The course examines the micro-architecture level
                implementation of a processor’s instruction set architecture (ISA) through the design of logic
                circuits and data pathways representing physical digital electronic devices (Bourque & Fairley,
                2014).</p>
            <p>This course relies on a constructivism approach to developing a learning environment that
                focuses on building content knowledge through activities over memorization (Moreno, et. al., 2007). Students will be presented with individual problems to solve,
                and work in small groups to develop a circuit design that satisfies required inputs and outputs at
                the individual bit level. The instructor and teaching assistants will act as resources and advisors
                throughout each lesson.</p>
            <p>The complexity of digital architecture and the speed of modern processors makes it difficult to
                conceptualize and assimilate how individual logic circuits combine in digital pathways to perform
                specific functions (Moreno, et. al., 2007). This course will rely on
                a combination of virtual and hands-on simulators that will allow students working in small groups
                to build and test individual logic circuits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-panel w3-left-align">
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>Cognitive learning in the design and analysis of a logic circuit applies to the acquisition of
                foundational knowledge of logic gates, Boolean algebra, truth tables and logic expressions. The
                full-adder circuit breaks down the arithmetic operators and instructions of a high-level
                programming language to binary arithmetic and the basic building block of the processor’s
                arithmetic logic unit (ALU).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-panel w3-left-align">
            <h4>Target Learner</h4>
            <p>Undergraduate software engineering and computing science students will have taken COP
                2006 Programming I and PHY 2048 General Physics I prior to taking CDA 3200 Digital Systems
                & Architecture. The following topics will have been covered in the course prior to this lesson:
                number systems, logic gates, truth-tables, and logic expressions, Boolean algebra, and circuit
                analysis.
                Students are first introduced to the 2-1 multiplexer circuit to practice circuit analysis. This lesson
                builds on the analysis of circuits while developing the first building-block that will be expanded
                on to design an ALU. The multiplexer will be combined with the ALU later in the course as we
                develop data-paths to and from the controller, memory, and the ALU. Students will begin to see
                their first physical digital logic-circuits representing programming language instructions and
                operators.</p>

            <h4>Teaching Approach / Activities</h4>
            <p>The activities in this lesson are performed by small groups of 2-3 students. Students organize themselves into groups at the start of class and stay in their groups throughout the activities.</p>
            <p>The instructor provides a short review of binary addition with a focus on the concepts of a bit-slice and the identification of the inputs: A, B, and carry-in, and outputs: sum and carry-out. Student work with the instructor to build a truth-table showing the inputs and outputs and then derive the Sum-of-Product (SOP) “minterm” expressions for the sum and carry-out functions.</p>
            <p>The instructor provides standardized expressions for both the sum and carry-out functions and student groups work on combining the functions into a single logic circuit with 3-inputs and 2-outputs, forming the full-adder. Students build their circuit physically with the logic-bit simulator devices and test their circuit against their truth tables.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><img src="Images/FullAddrActivity1.png" style="width: 500px; height:271px" alt="Activity 1"/></td>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The class groups combine their individual physical full-adder circuits into a multi-bit adder, and the class discusses its implementation in an ALU. Critical thinking topics include carry-in to bit-slice 0, individual input and sum-bits to number values, carry-out and overflow, and subtraction and signed numbers.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><img src="Images/FullAddrActivity2.png" style="width: 500px; height:271px" alt="Activity 2"/></td>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-left-align">
            <h4>Assessment and feedback from teaching</h4>
            <p>I regularly teach the Full-Adder lesson to undergraduate students in Digital Systems. Teaching methods have included interactive whiteboard sessions where students collaborate in small groups to design, analyze, and illustrate a full-adder circuit, as well as utilizing online circuit simulators like CircuitVerse.org for emulation and testing purposes. This lesson marked the first implementation introducing the logic-circuit electronic emulator boards for hands-on experience in constructing and testing circuits.</p>
            <p>Feedback from both peers and the professor highlighted the significance of the preparatory material leading up to this lesson in enhancing understanding and participation in the activities. However, it was noted that the review of essential concepts was somewhat rushed, according to their feedback.</p>
            <p>During the hands-on portion, I observed that students encountered challenges in correctly connecting electric components and wires, leading to delays in the activities and constraining the time available for discussion and critical thinking exercises.</p>
            <p>Overall feedback reflected positively on my teaching style, creating an engaging and enjoyable learning environment while effectively presenting the material. Despite some assistance, students successfully constructed the correct circuit and demonstrated the ability to anticipate and interpret the output values for a given set of inputs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-panel w3-left-align">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Throughout this semester course, I have delved deeper into formal learning and teaching philosophies and methodologies. I view my teaching style and interests as a blend of cognitive constructivism and social constructivism, emphasizing interactive approaches to teaching complex logic processes in an engaging manner. I believe that my lesson presentation effectively embodies the integration of these learning and teaching philosophies.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on my experiences and feedback, I have gained insight into refining my lesson planning by prioritizing learning objectives before individual assignments and activities. Employing a backward course design approach, I aim to strategically plan assessments that emphasize the value of computer organization and architecture design within software engineering and computer science programs (Fink, 2003). Subsequently, I will develop lectures, activities, and assignments that align with the learning objectives.</p>
            <p>Moving forward, I intend to further emphasize cognitive constructivism and social constructivism concepts in my courses. Specifically, my objective is to incorporate both individual work and group activities, while fostering a flexible pace that accommodates students' varying learning speeds. This approach will enable students to assimilate more material at an accelerated pace, while ensuring that all students cover core required objectives at their own pace.</p>
