      <h1 class="w3-medium w3-text-teal">Assignment Description:</h1>
      <p>The first business program I wrote was for my family's used car business to calculate
        finance charges on buy-here-pay-here car sales. Used car businesses, at the time, did not
        have the resources to calculate compounding interest (no MS Excel or the Internet),
        and the banks would charge $100 to call in and request a rate lookup from a table in a book.
        Needless to say our family sold copies of this program to other dealers in town for $900 each.
        The program was written in Basic language on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_PC-1401" target="_blank">Sharp PC-1401</a>
        programmable calculator with 4K of memory and a small thermal printer with serial connector.  A
        cassette player could be connected to the printer to save/write the program on a metallic cassette.</p>
      <p>In this assignment, you will write a C++ program that a car dealer can use during the sale of a car. The dealer
         will enter the sales price and discounts on the car and calculate taxes and fees to produce a Bill-of-Sale showing
         the unpaid balance of the car. The program will then prompt the dealer to indicate if the customer is paying cash,
         or requesting a loan. If the customer wishes to make payments to the dealer, then the dealer processes a loan.
         The dealer enters the annual percentage rate (<a href="https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/rates/" target="_blank">Bankrate.com</a>),
         and then indicates if the customer wishes to make a set number of monthly payments, i.e. 60 months (5 years), or
         if they would like to set a fixed monthly payment amount. After collecting the number of months or fixed payment amount,
         the program should calculate either the monthly payment amount given the principle, annual percentage rate, and number of months,
         or the number of monthly payments given the principle, annual percentage rate, and monthly payment amount. The total of payments
         can then be calculated as months * payment, and the interest paid as total of payments - principle. Lastly, the program should print out
         a well formatted Bill-of-Sale and Loan if financing is being offered.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-medium w3-text-teal">Assignment Purpose:</h1>
      <p>This assignment focuses on core C++ programming concepts to include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Constants</li>
        <li>Structs</li>
        <li>Modular Programming (Functions)</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container w3-left-align">
      <h1 class="w3-medium w3-text-teal">Requirements:</h1>
      <p><strong>Global constants:</strong> Constants increase the readability of programs by replacing meaningless
         literals with words that document their use. Constants should be used for any literals that represent values
         that would not change often, since modifying them requires recompiling the program. Placing select constants
         in <u>global scope</u> makes their values available throughout the program without a need to pass them as
         parameters.  Having them located at the top of the file provides ease of locating them, and for modifying
         them when configuration values change. Global constant names should be in <strong>ALL_CAPS</strong>
         to help identify them as global constants quickly in source code.</p>
      <p>Add the following global constants to your program (identifier, data-type, value)</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tax Rate</strong>, floating-point, 6.5%</li>
        <li><strong>Title Fee</strong>, floating-point, $75.25</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer Fee</strong>, floating-point, $7.85</li>
        <li><strong>Registration Fee</strong>, floating-point $14.50</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Structs:</strong> Structs are a C programming concept that allows a programmer to build a
        <u>user defined data type</u> made up of sub-properties that can have different data-types. The main
        purpose of the struct is to consolidate data logic of a program by placing multiple <u>related</u> variables into
        a single variable that can passed around to functions.  This further simplifies function definitions by reducing
        the number of parameters defined and arguments passed. Structs, like other type-definitions, should be defined
        in <u>global scope</u> at the top of the file to make them available for use in function declarations and source code.
        Struct names should be in <strong>UpperCamelCase</strong>. The leading capital letter helps identify them as a
        user defined data type</p>
      <p>Add the following structs to your program (identifier: property name, data-type, description)</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bill of Sale:</strong> represents the cost of the car to the consumer with sales tax and fees.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Price</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Entered sales price of the car.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Discount</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Entered sum of any down payment, trade-in, dealer discounts.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Tax</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Calculated sales tax amount.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Fees</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Sum of Title, Transfer, and Registration fees.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Unpaid Balance</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Calculated cost of the car.</span></li>
          </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Loan:</strong> represents financing if the buyer will be making payments to the dealer.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Principle</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Amount to finance.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Annual Rate</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Annual percentage rate of interest.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Months</strong>, integer, <span style="color: #008000">Number of monthly payments.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Payment</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Monthly payment amount.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Interest</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Total amount of interest paid on the loan.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Total Payments</strong>, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Total of payments including interest.</span></li>
          </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Contract:</strong> represent the sales contract for the purchase of the car.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bill of Sale</strong>, Bill of Sale, <span style="color: #008000">A Bill of Sale structure property.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Financed</strong>, Boolean, <span style="color: #008000">Flag to indicate if a loan is being calculated (true: calculate loan, false: paying cash).</span></li>
            <li><strong>Loan</strong>, Loan, <span style="color: #008000">A Loan structure property.</span></li>
          </ul></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Functions:</strong> Functions provide a way to modularize a program or consolidate logic into concise blocks
         that promote readability and reusability.  In general, any single block of code that takes more than one screen height
         increases complexity in a program by forcing the reader to scroll up and down to follow logic. Any areas of code that must
         be written more than once can be moved to functions reducing overall code and simplifying maintenance.  Multiple blocks of code
         can sometimes be consolidated just by introducing a parameter that provides a simple logic switch to handle minor differences.
         Some blocks of code can be generalized into functions that will serve many programs, which can speed up development and testing
         of future projects. Like variables, function identifiers should be in <strong>lowerCamelCase</strong></p>
      <p>Add the following functions to your program</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>main</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Control overall flow of the program.</li>
            <li><strong>Returns</strong>: 0, <span style="color: #008000">Exit status of program to the OS.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Parameters</strong>: None</li>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong>:<ul>
              <li>Create a main loop that asks the user if they want to continue entering sales contracts.</li>
              <li>Within the loop:<ul>

              </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong>:<ul>
              <li>Use the following to calculate the Payment Amount:
                <p>P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n))</p>

                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>P</strong> is the regular payment amount (the amount you need to pay each period, usually monthly).</li>
                  <li><strong>r</strong> is the monthly interest rate, expressed as a decimal (annual interest rate divided by 12).</li>
                  <li><strong>PV</strong> is the present value or principal amount of the loan.</li>
                  <li><strong>n</strong> is the total number of payments (loan term in months).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To break down the formula further:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Calculate the monthly interest rate (r): Convert the annual interest rate to a decimal by dividing it by 12 (for monthly payments).</li>
                  <p>r = (Annual Interest Rate) / (12 * 100)</p>

                  <li>Determine the total number of payments (n): Multiply the number of years by 12 to convert years into months.</li>
                  <p>n = Number of Years * 12</p>

                  <li>Substitute the values of r, PV, and n into the formula to calculate the payment amount (P).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Return the Payment Amount.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Libraries</strong><ul>
              <li><strong>&lt;cmath&gt;</strong>, <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/pow/" target="_blank">std::pow()</a> can be used to raise a value to an exponent.
              </li></ul></li>

        <li><strong>Calculate Months</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a generic function, similar to MS Excel's NPER function, that calculates the number of periodic periods of a loan with constant payments and constant interest rate.</li>

            <li><strong>Parameters</strong>: (all parameters should be pass-by-value)
              <ul>
                <li>Principle, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Amount of the loan.</span></li>
                <li>Rate, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Annual percentage rate.</span></li>
                <li>Payment, floating-point, <span style="color: #008000">Monthly payment amount.</span></li>
              </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong>:<ul>
              <li>Use the following to calculate the Number of Monthly Periods:
                <p>To calculate the number of periods (months) required to repay a loan with a set monthly payment, you can use the logarithmic functions. The formula is:</p>

                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>n</em> = number of periods (months)</li>
                  <li><em>PMT</em> = monthly payment</li>
                  <li><em>r</em> = monthly interest rate (decimal), calculated as annual interest rate divided by 12</li>
                  <li><em>PV</em> = present value or loan amount</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let's say you have a loan amount of $10,000, an annual interest rate of 6%, and a monthly payment of $200. First, you would need to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate:</p>

                <pre>
r = 0.06 / 12 = 0.005
    </pre>

                <p>Now you can plug in the values into the formula:</p>

                <pre>
n = ln((PMT / (PMT - r * PV))) / ln(1 + r)
    </pre>

                <p>Calculate the denominator first:</p>

                <pre>
ln(1 + r) &thickapprox; 0.002166
    </pre>

                <p>Next, calculate the numerator:</p>

                <pre>
(PMT / (PMT - r * PV)) &thickapprox; 1.333333
ln(1.333333) &thickapprox; 0.124939
    </pre>

                <p>Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:</p>

                <pre>
n &thickapprox; 0.124939 / 0.002166 &thickapprox; 57.68013596

    </pre>

                <p>Since the number of periods (months) must be a whole number, you would round up to the nearest whole month:</p>

                <pre>
n &thickapprox; 58
    </pre>

                <p>So, it would take approximately 58 months to repay the loan with a $200 monthly payment and a 6% annual interest rate on a $10,000 loan amount. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example and doesn't account for factors like compounding frequency, additional fees, or changes in interest rates over time.</p>
