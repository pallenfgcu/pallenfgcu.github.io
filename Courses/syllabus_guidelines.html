    <h1 class="w3-medium w3-text-teal">COVID-19 Information</h1>
    <p>Campus leaders continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and are prepared to step up mitigation efforts as needed.
        Our best line of defense is you. For the latest information regarding COVID-19 health and safety measures at FGCU,
        and related community resources, visit the Protect The Nest Page at <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/coronaupdate/" target="_blank">https://www.fgcu.edu/coronaupdate/</a>.
        It is  strongly recommended that you follow these steps to decrease your chances of missing class, work, research,
        athletic events, and other on-campus activities:
        <ul>
            <li>Become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and get a booster, if able.</li>
            <li>Make healthy choices regarding activities you participate in.</li>
            <li>Stay home if you are sick, for any reason, and seek testing and medical advice before reengaging in campus
                activities, including classes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>It is the student’s responsibility to share medical notes with instructors. Faculty are encouraged to accommodate
        students as best they can and handle absences due to COVID-19 just like they would for any contagious illness,
        such as the common cold, flu or strep.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-medium w3-text-teal">Student Recordings of Courses</h1>
    <p>Consistent with Legislation effective as of July 1, 2021, a student may, without prior notice, record
        (video or audio) a faculty lecture for the limited purpose of 1) personal educational use, 2) for use in a
        complaint against the institution, or 3) for use as evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding. Recordings
        for any other purpose (except as a permitted accommodation) are not permitted. Recordings that are
        accomplished in such a way as to cause disruption to the learning environment can be prohibited. Such
        a recorded lecture may not be made public to a third party (i.e. publish) without the faculty member’s
        prior, written consent. Moreover, students are expressly prohibited from recording any other student in
        such a manner that personally identifies the student. Some negligible/inconsequential recording of a
        student’s voice as a by-product of recording will not be deemed a violation of a permitted recording.</p>
