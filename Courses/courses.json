Topics include, but are not limited to, modularity (classes and packages); object-oriented concepts (e.g., encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism); error handling and exceptions; generics/templates; dynamic constructs and memory management encompassing pointer arithmetic, parameter passing, and dereferencing; and reuse of API/frameworks/libraries/packages (e.g., GUI, networking, persistence storage, and web). Relevant programming environments and tools (e.g., build tools), especially in the context of software engineering are also experienced. This course is delivered in C++ unless noted otherwise.",
